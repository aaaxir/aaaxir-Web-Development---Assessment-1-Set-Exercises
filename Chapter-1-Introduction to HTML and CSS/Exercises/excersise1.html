        <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>2-3 green chilies, slit</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>4-5 cardamom pods</li>
        <li>4-5 cloves</li>
        <li>2-inch cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (optional garnish)</li>
        <li>Fried onions (optional garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat ghee and oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the whole spices (fennel seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon) and sauté until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies, and sauté for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and mushy.</li>
        <li>Now add the chicken pieces and cook until they are browned.</li>
        <li>Whisk the yogurt with turmeric powder, red chili powder, and garam masala. Add this mixture to the pot and mix well.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and let the chicken cook until tender, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add salt and soaked rice. Cook the rice until it is 70-80% done. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked and the gravy is thick, layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken gravy.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and aromatic.</li>
        <li>Once done, gently mix the rice and chicken together.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, garnished with fresh coriander leaves and fried onions if desired.</li>
    </ol>
